# Deep Learning Applications
This repository contains three laboratory activities:
- Lab1-CNNs: contains an implementation of Convolutional Neural Network and an implementation of Multi Layer Perceptron, in both cases there is a standard version and a residual version. In addition, as an optional exercise,Class Activation Mapping has been implemented, which allows the most relevant regions in the CNN decision-making process to be identified.
- Lab3-Trasformers: contains the implementations of different approaches for fine-tuning transformer models on sentiment analysis tasks, with a focus on efficient parameter training end on Paramiter-Efficient Fine Tuning.
- Lab4_OOD: contains the implementations of Out Of Distribution Detection techinques and defence tecniques against adversarial attacks.
